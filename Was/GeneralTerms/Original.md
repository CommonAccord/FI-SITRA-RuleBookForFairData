3 ROLE-SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1 The potential roles defined under these General Terms and Conditions for the Parties to the Constitutive Agreement are (1) the Data Source, (2) the Service Provider, (3) the End User and (4) the Operator. A Party may simultaneously occupy multiple roles. In such case, the relevant Party must comply with all applicable obligations related to each role and relevant Data. In addition, Third Party End User is a role recognised under these General Terms and Conditions as applying to any stakeholders who are not a Party to the Constitutive Agreement but who receive Data.

3.2 A more specific description of the roles and the determination of role-specific responsibilities may be included in the Constitutive Agreement.

3.1 Data Source

3.3 The Data Source will be responsible for defining the Dataset Terms of Use for any Data that the Data Source makes available within the Network. This includes, without limitation, the right to define the purposes for which relevant Data can be processed, the right to allow the redistribution of Data to End Users and, where applicable, to Third Party End Users, and the right to prohibit the unauthorised use of Data and the right to refrain from sharing Data within the Network. The Data Source must notify the Parties to whom the Data Source makes the Dataset available of any new Dataset Terms of Use, after which the Dataset Terms of Use will be considered to constitute an Appendix to the Constitutive Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in the applicable Dataset Terms of Use, any changes introduced by the Data Source to the applicable Dataset Terms of Use will become effective within fourteen (14) days from the relevant Parties to the Network being sent a notification of such change. For the avoidance of doubt, changes to the Dataset Terms of must not have retroactive effect.

3.4 The Data Source will be responsible for providing Data for the use of the Network in a machine-readable form and by a method as defined by the Data Source in the applicable Dataset Terms of Use (e.g. application programming interface, downloadable package or other method).

3.5 The Data Source must ensure the lawfulness and origin of the data and represent and warrant that the data does not infringe any Intellectual Property Rights or Confidential Information in the country where the Data Source is established.

3.6 As an exception to the above clause 3.3, the Data Source may undertake to grant the right to use certain specific Datasets or types of data to the Network for a fixed period, as defined in the Constitutive Agreement, in order to protect investments made in the Network by other Parties in good faith.

3.2 Service Provider

3.7 The Service Provider will be responsible for processing Data in accordance with the Constitutive Agreement and the applicable Dataset Terms of Use.

3.8 The Service Provider must keep records of its processing activities and deliver, on request, reasonably detailed reports on usage, processing and redistribution of Data to the relevant Data Source(s).

3.3 End User

3.9 The End User must use Data in accordance with the Constitutive Agreement and the applicable Dataset Terms of Use.

3.4 Operator

3.10 The Network may involve one or several Operators. The Operator(s) are responsible for providing the Network with services that facilitate the operations of the relevant Data Network, such as authentication, identification, and identity/consent management services or for ensuring data security or providing technical data protection solutions for the Network and as further defined in the applicable Operator Service Agreement.

3.11 Any Operator Service Agreement(s) concluded with the Party/Parties and the Operator(s) may be included as an Appendix to the Constitutive Agreement.

4 REDISTRIBUTION OF DATA

4.1 Service Providers can redistribute Data to Third Party End Users only where permitted under the applicable Dataset Terms of Use. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties are entitled to redistribute Derived Materials to any Third Party End Users, unless specifically prohibited in the applicable Dataset Terms of Use and provided that the Data Source’s Intellectual Property Rights do not restrict such redistribution. However, the redistribution of any Personal Data or Derived Materials created on the basis of any Personal Data is always subject to the more detailed requirements disclosed in the applicable Dataset Terms of Use and applicable data protection laws.

4.2 Where the Data Source permits the redistribution of Data to Third Party End Users, the Data Source is responsible for defining further the applicable terms and conditions for the redistribution of Data in the respective Dataset Terms of Use. Service Providers are obliged to include such terms and conditions in any agreements they conclude with their Third Party End Users with regard to the redistribution of Data.

4.3 Notwithstanding the above, the Parties are entitled to redistribute any Data to their Affiliates, unless such redistribution is specifically prohibited in the applicable Dataset Terms of Use. Each Party will be responsible for ensuring that its respective Affiliates comply with the terms and conditions of the Constitutive Agreement.

5 GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND CAPABILITIES

5.1 Each Party must designate a contact person for data security matters, who is responsible for the relevant Party’s data systems that are connected to the Network and for the implementation of the Party’s security policy.

5.2 Each Party to the Data Network must have, in accordance with its role, sufficient capabilities to process Data securely and in accordance with the relevant data security standards and data protection legislation. The Parties must implement and maintain suitable technical, organisational and physical measures that are in line with good market practice, by taking into account the nature of the Data processed by the Party. Each Party must have the capability to properly perform its obligations under the Constitutive Agreement and applicable Dataset Terms of Use and, where necessary, to cease processing activities without undue delay for any relevant reason.

7 CONFIDENTIALITY

7.1 The Parties must use any Confidential Information they receive in connection with the operation of the Data Network and/or regarding the Data Network only for the purposes for which such Confidential Information has been provided. The Parties must not unlawfully use or disclose to Third Parties any such Confidential Information they have become aware of in the course of the operation of the Data Network.

7.2 At the expiration or termination of the Constitutive Agreement, the Parties must cease to use Confidential Information and, upon request by any Party, verifiably return or destroy any Confidential Material, including copies thereof. Notwithstanding the above, the Parties are entitled to continue to use the Data subject to clause 10.2. In addition, the Parties will retain Confidential Material as required by the applicable law or competent authorities.

7.3 If a Party is, under the applicable law or an order issued by a competent authority, obliged to disclose another Party's Confidential Information to the authorities or Third Parties, the obliged Party must promptly notify the affected Party whose Confidential Information will be disclosed of such disclosure if so permitted under the applicable law or the competent authority’s order.

For the avoidance of doubt, any new Intellectual Property Rights created by a Party will vest in the creating Party as further defined in the applicable legislation governing Intellectual Property Rights.

8.3 Where the Data Source charges the other Parties a fee for its Data, the Data Source indemnifies the paying Parties against claims that the Data subject to any such fees infringes Intellectual Property Rights in the country of the Data Source, provided that the Data Source is notified of these claims in writing without undue delay.

8.4 The Parties are entitled to utilise software robots or other forms and applications of robotic process automation or machine learning or artificial intelligence when processing Data, provided that they respect the confidentiality obligations set out in clause 7 and the data protection obligations set out in clause 9.

9.2 Terms that are not defined here, have the meaning stated in the GDPR or other applicable data protection laws.

9.3 For the purposes of processing Personal Data within the Network, any Parties disclosing or receiving Data are, individually and separately, assumed to be controllers under the provisions of the GDPR.

Where any such Data Processing Agreement is applicable in general to certain Dataset(s) or services provided under the Constitutive Agreement, it must be included as an Appendix to the Constitutive Agreement.
